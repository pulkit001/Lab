Prof.Rahul Nabar

Agenda
1.Intro-include the opinions and feedback of students,
.Start with the Document
.Started working on equipment list
.Current Situation-Shortlist equipment for Phase-1
.Design cell plan layout

2.Ask about industrial topics-feasibility-scalable projects
.Tell about 3D-Printer-Ask about opinions
.Ask about UG Labs
_
General Feedback
.HT and fluid mech-Equipment already exists-try not to duplicate them-digitising them would be a great project(get the equipment from UG lab)
.Generate interest within the Lab-have interesting Projects-find the balance between tough and easy projects
.Try to make the Lab project-centric, students wont have interest to come and look at equipment-give tasks to students
.Try to make projects which has connections to other domains like ML,etc
.M.Tech-they are an asset to us-useful in mentoring and might have good ideas-Talk to HOD
.Projects can be focused on how to build cheap equipment

Feedback on long term ideas-
LT1-Good initiative
LT2-Great work might make Azeotropy more interesting-Ask Azeotropy team my IIT participation is very low
LT3-Conduct workshops on ChemE specific software-Labview,Opto
.must gauge interest within the students before the event-people should turn up(recurring problem in our Dept
.Research about ChemE specific digitisation

Feedback on Short Term Events
.Make some talks relevant to current industry-Prof Nabar ready to help us out
.Prof. Nabar ready to do some mentoring etc in the initial stages to give students an idea
.Conduct competitions on making some basic instruments-pumps etc

Vendors
.Talk to them-They will be ready for talks etc,they can also gift equipment or give discounts-If the project has good impact
.Focus on project Kits

ML-Software related(Industry 4.0)
.A great avenue for exploration
.Try to form a tech team in our dept
.can work on a reactor(small) and use sensors etc to digitise it-will be of great use in the Resume
.We are good on software skills-need to introduce students to hardware side,sensors etc-to acquire data(data acquisition cards)
.Try to create digital twins

Micro-Fluidics
.The other end of the spectrum-Talk to profs related to that
.Can be produced with 3D printers
.BioChem related projects-maybe sometime in the long run-needs mentors and additional help-might need an air conditioned room

Budget related
.Split the budget into two-Capital and Running Costs-contact GSTA to get to know the annual budget of the Lab.
.no use in having equipment but not enough money to maintain them
.Give the sponsors Phase-1 list-made up of sensors,basic equipment like centrifuge and 3D printer

Further Plan of Action
.Research about Industry 4.0
.Research about ChemE specific software etc
.Find out about the National competitions in ChemE,then maybe for a tech team around that
.Meet with Prof.Sanjay mahajani-to get to know about micro reactors etc
.Meet with Profs involved in microfluidics
.Set the bar high for the Lab-we have enough Budget to do that.
