Meet with Prof. Mahajani (24 july)

Lohkesh told him aim of lab, focus on microfluidics and industry 4.0
sir said he would've suggested the same
sir asked why curriculum based should be there, Senthil said it's sponsors idea to get industry experience
overall still under debate.

Introduce related to reactions and controls, not just heat and fluids -- advantage of those two is that it is more related to freshies and sophies
suggested students should build rather than source things from outside so students build setup themselves.

how to get students interest?
Even existing TL is not used by a lot of people, so don't worry about how many use ChemE TL; just ensure those who do use your lab enjoy the experience
will need time to popularise this as culture has to be changed(working with hands has to be introduced)

Think of webinars, seminars, hackathons etc. as students will have a tendency to stay away, just ensure that students who do use it enjoy
let it be at smaller scale, too many people will increase load on lab and will affect performance of serious students

Sponsors need update from us about list of equipment as it is a time-taking process
Sir suggests buying equipment will not serve the purpose, but buy the tools that will help build setup..
mechanical and elec fabeication
mech -- digital(3d printer, laser cutter, sophisticated, small) and heavy(metals and machines, rolling machines, working with pipes and plumbing etc)
elec -- circuit boards, soldering, voltmeter (quite standard, and so every TL should have this)
Meet Prof. Narona and lab incarge of Tata centre
give students demos on how to use these tools and let them come up with projects

try to see how lab operates remotely
encourage development and proposals by students

very few TLs in chemical space, so chance to do something innovative
wet chemistry, analytics like hydrometer, refractive index, gas chromatography
buying everything in advance is not a good idea, do on ad-hoc basis based on what students want

now that everything is online, arrange workshops and webinars on what is possible wrt digitalisaion and industry 4.0, and then ask them to come back with proposals and ideas, validate them, and then decide what is to be bought
ask sponsors to wait because buying equipment should not be done in a hurry
try to replicate model of UG 3rd year lab held 2 years ago

bottom line, don't buy things in advance if you don't know how much they'll be used later -- they will take up money and space and maintenance

sets of people who participate in TL -- innovators, and people who participate in competitions just for resume points
culture of universities like MIT quite different and should be inculcated as it's not too late
support students in 1st category, give incentives to others to buil genuine interest
give as much exposure as possible


on't sell this so hard that people start coming just for resume points, maintain a good balance

our institute students don't participate in actual event, they just focus on managerial positions for resume points
azeotropy is good, but shoudl encourage iit students instead of outsiders to participate

microreactors:
readymade set ups for microreactors are available, good exercise for fabrication
but if aim is to do actual reaction, don't spend time on fabrication
companies in india also make

make division of ChemE TL for people who want to work on chemistry and reactions else lab will become same as existing TL

facility for AI/ML coming up near hostel 7
AI/ML will take over non-hazardous industries like manufacturing, but more difficult to do it for somehting like chemical

form a techteam around the lab?
